# Improving CNN Performance through Generative AI: A Data Augmentation Approach

This project investigates the impact of generative AI on the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks, specifically in the context of limited data. Three distinct CNN models were implemented and com- pared, each trained on a unique dataset: the original images of cats and dogs, the same images augmented by OpenAIâ€™s DALL-E, and a further enhanced dataset with neural style transfer applied. The findings highlight the potential of using generative AI for data augmentation. The model trained on the most augmented dataset achieved the highest accuracy of 90.86% on the test set, which was a 3.16% increase over the model trained on the original dataset. The study underscores the value of integrating state-of-the-art AI methods to improve the generalizability and performance of CNNs, even in data-limited scenarios.
